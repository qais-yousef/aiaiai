Aiaiai is a tool for validating Linux kernel patches using various available
open-source tools. Aiaiai is useful for both subsystem maintainers and
kernel developers.

Aiaiai usage scenarios include:

1. a developer has a patch-set which he/she wants to validate before submitting
   to the maintainer or the subsystem mailing list
2. a subsystem maintainer validates incoming patches before merging them to the
   subsystem kernel tree

Aiaiai roughly works as follows.

1. Build the kernel before applying the patch-set and after applying the
   patch-set.
2. Run the following static analysis tools while building: sparse, smatch,
   coccinelle, cppcheck.
3. Compare the resulting build logs in a smart way (taking into account line
   number changes, etc)
3. Report about new gcc warnings and coccinelle/sparse/smatch/cppcheck
   complaints. If checkpatch.pl has any complaints, they are also reported by
   Aiaiai.

Here is an example of Aiaiai report.

o Line 1 says that configuration "my_defconfig" for architecture i386 has been
  built (so the patch-set compiles).
o Starting from line 3 we have a diff of 2 build logs - before and after
  patching.
o Lines 6 and 7 tell that the patch-set eliminated a warning, which is very
  welcome.
o Lines 9 and 10 tell that the patch-set introduced a gcc warning, which is
  less welcome.
o Line 11 a complaint form coccinelle about locking. Worth looking closer.
  The coccinelle scripts that are part of the Linux kernel do not usually
  produce many false positives.
o Line 12 tells that smatch has a complaint.

Additionally, Aiaiai runs the bisectability test when there is more than one
patch. It applies patches one-by-one, compiles at each step, and reports if
compilation breaks.

Aiaiai also runs checkpatch.pl for the whole patch-set (squashed) and
every individual patch.

Following are the currently implemented ways of using Aiaiai.
1. Just run 'aiaiai-test-patchset' from console
2. Attach Aiaiai to a mailing list using the e-mail front-end
3. Attach Aiaiai to gerrit using a the Jenkins gerrit notifications plugin.
