This is the project TODO list. It contains the wish list of Aiaiai author and
users. Feel free to send your requests to the Aiaiai mailing list. Remembere,
these are just wishes, and we do not necessarily have any specific plans
implementing them.


* Improve user-friendliness.
  * Separate all the e-mail front-end stuff to "doc/email".
  * Improve the the e-mail front-end configuration file. Make all the variables
    containing the text for end-users to refer instead. Just like
    email.preamble refers the file, which contains the preamble. This is more
    flexible and consistent.
  * Eventually make non-email scripts (aiaiai-test-patchset) also
    support the config file. This could be an alternative to specifying
    everythig via options. E.g., would could run
    'aiaia-test-patchset --config <path>/aiaiai.cfg' and have all the
    details defined in 'aiaiai.cfg'.
  * Start assigning versions to the scripts and do official releases, with
    signed tags, and tarballs.
  * Provide packages for various distributions. Including packages for the
    'smack' validation tool, because distros do not provide it.
  * Describe the coding style and various shell tricks in a separate file, in
    order to make it easier for people to start hacking Aiaiai.
  * Describe how the e-mail front-end distinguish patches and collects
    patch-sets.
  * Describe some review policy, e.g., how many days I promise to wait
    for review/reply before applying patches.

* Functional improvements
  * Gcc 4.8 change the format of warnings and now they look like this:

    arch/x86/kernel/e820.c: In function ‘e820_setup_gap’:
    arch/x86/kernel/e820.c:630:6: warning: variable ‘found’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
      int found;
          ^
    Aiaiai does not process them correctly which leads to ugly diffs. Fix this.
