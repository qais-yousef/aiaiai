This is the project TODO list. It contains the wish list of Aiaiai author and
users. Feel free to send your requests to the Aiaiai mailing list. Remembere,
these are just wishes, and we do not necessarily have any specific plans
implementing them.


* Improve user-friendliness.
  * Separate all the e-mail front-end stuff to "doc/email".
  * Improve the the e-mail front-end configuration file. Make all the variables
    containing the text for end-users to refer instead. Just like
    email.preamble refers the file, which contains the preamble. This is more
    flexible and consistent.
  * Move command-line options of 'aiaiai-email-*' scripts to the configuration
    file. This should make it simpler for users to configure the whole thing
    when all the knobs are in one place. Just make each script to parse the
    config file and pick own configuration from there.
  * Start assigning versions to the scripts and do official releases, with
    signed tags, and tarballs.
  * Provide packages for various distributions. Including packages for the
    'smack' validation tool, because distros do not provide it.
  * Describe the coding style and various shell tricks in a separate file, in
    order to make it easier for people to start hacking Aiaiai.
  * Describe how the e-mail front-end distinguish patches and collects
    patch-sets.
  * Teach the scripts to compile 'remap-log' if it is not compiled,
    instead of just failing. This is probably more user-friendly.
  * Describe some review policy, e.g., how many days I promise to wait
    for review/reply before applying patches.

* Functional improvements
  * Stop carrying own copies of checkpatch.pl and coccinelle. Just use the ones
    from the project kernel tree. For those who uses old kernels but want to
    benefit from new checkpatch.pl/coccinelle scripts, allow to specify path
    to the upstream kernel, and pick the scripts from there instead of picking
    them from the project kernel sources.
