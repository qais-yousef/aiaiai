1 Overview
~~~~~~~~~~

This folder contains a set of systemd user services intended for use with
systemd's User instance service manager. It includes a service file for the
aiaiai main process, as well as a timer and service for keeping remote
repositories up to date.

These services can be configured to run on systemd's root instance by using
"User=aiaiai", assuming your host system is running as aiaiai.

The send-mail-on-failure script and service are intended to email the system
administrator when the services fail. You probably want to customize it for
your own email address.

1.1 aiaiai-project-update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

aiaiai-project-update is a script which reads the configuration file for
repository paths, and runs remote-update on them. This enables automatic update
of the remote repositories in a local cache. This helps prevent needing to
specify remote url as the repository to clone from, and can reduce delay when
running several patch tests at once, since each can clone locally instead of
from the remote server.
