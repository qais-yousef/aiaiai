Usage: $PROG <mbox_files>

<mbox_files> - a list of mbox files to concatenate.

This is a simple script which concatenates several mbox files into one. The
resulting mbox is printed to stdout.

Note, using just "cat" to contatenate the files is not going to produce a
correct mbox because there won't be the required blank line between the e-mails
in the resulting mbox.
